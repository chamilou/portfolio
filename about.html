                My name is Shamil and my origins goes to Caucasus. Yes the Caucasus where according the legends was attached for a torture Prometheus the Olympian god Titan, because he taught the people to make a fire, so gave them a knowledge. Zeus the king of Olympian
                gods became mad about this and ordered to chain him to mountain and the powerful bird came every day and ripped his liver. But as he was immortal god, the liver grew again the morning and his pain and torture continued until he was liberated
                by hero Heracles.

                It is just a legend, but I still come from Caucasus and now I`m in <span class="cv"> Biderstrasse 44, Bern, Switzerland</span>! My journey was long but I learned and experienced so many things which made me who I am now. My first big achievement
                was when I did the University and become a Teacher! Philology, French and Russian teacher, that was a time in last century in 1995! Looks like very, very longtime ago! I did teach kids in school Russian and French language. It was amazing
                but I was looking for something bigger! So I did apply and was accepted in French Bioforce Institut. It is well known school for humanitarian field workers ! and I choose to be Logistician. Why Logistician?

                I was always fond and fun of technical skills. Can you bieleve or not I was studying the BASIC «Micron» language from the magazines about Radio electronics at age 14. It looks like that: At this time I was dreaming to buy a computer abut it was so expensive
                I could never afford it.

                The choice of being teacher was not really from my heart but more tradition of the family. My father being English teacher did learn a lot and gave me a lot as starting point to become open minded person.

                So with Diploma as Logistic specialist which I obtained in Lyon France I started my first mission in Sudan Darfur in 2004 with MSF. Our project was for displaced population from South Part of Sudan (at this time, it was only one Sudan) after violent clashes
                between different ethic groups. The distress, pain, injustice, inequality and the situation of those people took whole my mind and I continue to work at the same field but in different countries.
            </p>
            <p class="about">

                Second mission was in Uganda in 2005, Uganda was ravaged by civil war and terrorized by LRA group. Lord Resistance Army were kidnapping and training kids to become a solder. Our project was supporting the kids known as “Night Commuters” offering them
                the shelter medical support and security. “Night Commuters” were kids between around 5- 15 years send by parents to sleep over the night to our center. They arrived evening sleep over and returned morning to their home. Parents were so
                afraid that LRA group will kidnap them so deliberately sending them to our center. They all walked around 15-20 km every evening and back every morning! It was something unbelievable!

            <p class="about">

                Next country was Iraq, Erbil in 2007. Again civil war and recovering period, hard time for the population. Our project was to support the population escaping from Mosul and other central regions of Iraq by offering the surgery, medications and shelter
                with the hygiene and food kits.

                In Liberia in 2008, I was first time Logistic Coordinator! It is a Logistic specialist but instead of one project for whole country. I was fascinated by a history of Liberia, how it created in early 1800 by Afro-Americans who bieleved the better future
                for them in being back to the origin… Liberia is a beautiful country with a tropical climate and rubber trees everywhere. 2000 years ago pelota game was popular ritual game in Central America. And they use a rubber ball which was made
                from Rubber tree! Until 1844 the Rubber tree was not so popular in the world, but first latex volcanized into real rubber change the game. Until 1876 the Rubber tree plantation was monopolized by Brazilian manufactures, but then after
                it was spread around the world by British Empire Today all car tires, phone covers and many other objects around us made from Rubber tree jus, without we are realizing this…. Liberia has one of the biggest Rubber plantation in the world
                (Firestone). Our project was around the primary health care and support to the population in rural areas
